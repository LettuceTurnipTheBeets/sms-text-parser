# sms-text-parser

This program works with the Android program 'SMS Backup & Restore'.  It takes in the backup .xml file that is generated by the Android program and reduces it down to one thread with one person.  This is useful if you're trying to refactor the backup .xml file into a readable file.

## Example:

    text-parser('sms-backup-20170516', 'John Smith')
